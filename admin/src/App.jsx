//using this react-router-dom we will create routes
//using react-toastify, we will display toast notification
//we will fix this port in react project, so that when we run this project in any order port number will be same, right now backend is running at port 4000 and frontend is running on port 5173 amd admin panel is running at 5174, so that when we stop project, first we will start the admin panel at 5173 and frontend at 5173, so to prevent that we will go to vite.config file
